# Backend Feature and Functionality Document for Airbnb Clone

This document details the core functionalities and technical requirements for the backend of the Airbnb clone, ensuring a robust and scalable rental marketplace platform.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management

The backend will support comprehensive user management, allowing different roles and secure access.

- **User Registration:**
  - Enable users to sign up as either **guests** or **hosts**.
  - Utilize **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication during registration.
- **User Login and Authentication:**
  - Implement login functionality using email and password.
  - Integrate **OAuth** options for convenient login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Profile Management:**
  - Allow users to update their personal profiles, including profile photos, contact information, and preferences.

### 2. Property Listings Management

Hosts will have full control over their property listings.

- **Add Listings:**
  - Hosts can create new property listings, providing essential details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings:**
  - Hosts can modify or remove their existing property listings as needed.

### 3. Search and Filtering

Robust search and filtering capabilities will allow users to easily find desired properties.

- Implement search functionality to enable users to find properties based on:
  - **Location**
  - **Price range**
  - **Number of guests**
  - **Amenities** (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
- Include **pagination** for efficient handling of large datasets in search results.

### 4. Booking Management

The backend will manage the entire booking lifecycle, from creation to cancellation.

- **Booking Creation:**
  - Guests can book a property for specified dates.
  - Implement **date validation** to prevent double bookings for the same property.
- **Booking Cancellation:**
  - Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings, adhering to predefined cancellation policies.
- **Booking Status:**
  - Track and update booking statuses, including: pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

### 5. Payment Integration

Secure payment processing will be a core component of the platform.

- Integrate with secure payment gateways (e.g., **Stripe, PayPal**) to handle:
  - **Upfront payments** by guests for bookings.
  - **Automatic payouts** to hosts upon completion of a booking.
- Include support for **multiple currencies**.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

A system for reviews and ratings will foster trust and provide valuable feedback.

- Guests can leave **reviews and ratings** for properties they have stayed in.
- Hosts can **respond to reviews** left on their properties.
- Ensure reviews are directly linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse and ensure authenticity.

### 7. Notifications System

An effective notification system will keep users informed of important events.

- Implement email and in-app notifications for:
  - **Booking confirmations**
  - **Cancellations**
  - **Payment updates**

### 8. Admin Dashboard

A dedicated admin interface will facilitate platform oversight and management.

- Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
  - **Users**
  - **Listings**
  - **Bookings**
  - **Payments**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Use a **relational database** such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
- Required tables include:
  - `Users` (to store guest and host information)
  - `Properties`
  - `Bookings`
  - `Reviews`
  - `Payments`

### 2. API Development

- Develop **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- Utilize proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
  - `GET` (retrieve data)
  - `POST` (create data)
  - `PUT`/`PATCH` (update data)
  - `DELETE` (remove data)
- **GraphQL** is recommended (optional) for complex data fetching scenarios.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- Implement **JWT** for secure user sessions.
- Utilize **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to differentiate permissions for:
  - Guests
  - Hosts
  - Admins

### 4. File Storage

- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**. The implementation will use a generic "file storage" solution.

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Integrate email services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for sending email notifications.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement comprehensive **global error handling** for all APIs.
- Set up robust **logging** to track system behavior and issues.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

- Design a **modular architecture** to ensure the application can scale easily with increasing traffic.
- Enable **horizontal scaling** using load balancers to distribute incoming requests.

### 2. Security

- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using **encryption**.
- Implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting** to prevent malicious activities and protect against common web vulnerabilities.

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Utilize **caching tools** like **Redis** to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- Optimize **database queries** to minimize server load and enhance data retrieval efficiency.

### 4. Testing

- Implement **unit and integration tests** using frameworks like **pytest**.
- Include **automated API testing** to ensure all endpoints function as expected and maintain data integrity.
